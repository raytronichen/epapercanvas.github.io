Someone on Reddit asked me a question:

"I love e-ink tech, and I'm excited to see what it can do in the future. For now, I want to know about how realistically we can make photos display on E-ink. Obviously resolution is not really an issue, but the color rendition side of things are. Are there limits to our current Spectra 6 color model that prevent certain colors from showing?

I'm looking forward to a screen that renders photos properly life-like, rather than an artistic style."

My answer:

Yes, Spectra 6 color does have limitations. For high-brightness, high-luminance magenta and cyan, these colors cannot be fully covered by the existing color particles.

However, when it comes to realistic photos, especially portraits, Spectra 6 can achieve excellent results through appropriate optimization algorithms.

在Reddit上有人问了我一个问题：

"我喜欢电子纸技术，对它的未来潜力感到兴奋。现在，我想知道我们能在多大程度上让照片在电子纸上显示。显然分辨率不是问题，但色彩还原方面确实存在挑战。我们当前的Spectra 6色彩模型是否存在限制，导致某些颜色无法显示？

我期待一个能够真实还原照片的屏幕，而不是艺术风格的效果。"

我的回答是：

没错，Spectra 6 color的色彩是有限制的，对于高明度高亮度的洋红和青色，是无法被现有的颜色粒子所覆盖的。

不过，关于真实照片，特别是人像，Spectra 6 通过合适的优化算法，可以做到很好。
